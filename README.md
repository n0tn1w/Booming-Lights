# Booming-Lights

An IoT project in which we have a set of LED lights connected to an ESP32 microcontroller. We have a website that you need to host online via your router. From the website, you can control the color of the lights using the RGB scepter. Additionally, you can make the lights respond to real-world music by using a microphone to make them glow up and down in rhythm with the music. This functionality is achieved by transforming the sound wave via Fast Fourier transform into a power output to the LEDs.
